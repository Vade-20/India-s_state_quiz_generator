Random Quiz Generator
This Python program generates a specified number of question papers and answer sheets on India states and their capitals. It shuffles the order of the states and the answer choices for each question.

How to use
Run the Python program random_quiz_generator.py.
Enter the total number of question papers you want to create.
The program will create two folders in the current working directory:
question_paper - contains the generated question papers
answer_sheet - contains the answer sheets for the question papers
Open the generated question papers and distribute them among the students.
After the students have answered the questions, use the answer sheets to grade the papers.
Note: If the program is not run in a directory named random_quiz_generator, the generated folders will be named question_paper and answer_sheet. If the program is run in a directory named random_quiz_generator, the generated folders will be created directly inside that directory.
